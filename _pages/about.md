*"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." -- Steve Jobs*

Welcome! I'm **Yongqiang Zhao (Rancho, 赵永强)**. 

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). This website serves as a platform for academic sharing, where I showcase my publications, talks, portfolio, and blog posts. My primary research focuses on the exciting fields of ***robotic manipulation***, ***tactile sensing***, and ***reinforcement learning***. Feel free to explore and delve into my work in these areas.
