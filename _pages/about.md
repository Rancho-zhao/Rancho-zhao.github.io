  *"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." -- Steve Jobs*

  Welcome! I'm **Yongqiang Zhao (Rancho, 赵永强)**. 
  I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). Before that, I received a Bachelor's degree in Robot Engineering from the same university. This website serves as a platform for personal sharing, where I showcase my publications, projects, blogs, CV and habbies. My primary research focuses on the exciting fields of ***robotic manipulation***, ***tactile sensing***, and ***robot learning***. Feel free to explore and delve into my work in these areas.
