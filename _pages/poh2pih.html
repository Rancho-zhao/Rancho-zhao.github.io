    <h1> Sim-to-Real Peg-in-Hole Assembly Learned from Peg-out-Hole Disassembly</h1>

    <!-- Abstract Section -->
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Peg-in-hole assembly is a fundamental and challenging robotic manipulation task. While reinforcement learning can address this problem to some extent, it has inherent limitations, such as the need for extensive exploration and well-designed reward functions. Inspired by humans' ability to transfer skills to unseen but related ones, we propose a novel skill learning framework that can achieve Sim-to-Real peg-in-hole (PiH) assembly via a learned peg-out-hole (PoH) policy. The framework consists of two main modules: (1) a PoH-to-PiH policy learning method that learns the oracle peg-out-hole policy using reinforcement learning with privileged information, followed by training a visual-motor peg-in-hole policy through behavior cloning from reversed trajectories collected during the replay of the trained peg-out-hole policy; and (2) a real-world fine-tuning method that leverages discrete tactile contact configurations. Compared to direct reinforcement learning approaches, our method achieves twofold improvement in both learning speed and Sim-to-Sim success rate. Extensive Sim-to-Real experiments across single-arm and dual-arm robot configurations and varied peg/hole geometries validate our framework's effectiveness, achieving 91.3% average success rates across all test objects.    </p>
